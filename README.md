# ZelloSvxLink
If you're into Ham Radio, Svxlink and Zello, you may like this.

It's a virtual machine that can be used as a POC (Packet Over Cellular) / Network Radio (Zello) svxlink node.

You can also set it up and use it as an outerlink to Zello for any Svxlink Analogic Network Reflector.

See https://439100.ro and https://svx.439100.ro to check a live one called ZelloLink for Romania's RoLink Svxlink Analogic Ham Radio network.

All needed instructions on how to set it up for your own use can be found on the virtual machine's desktop.

To understand what it contains, how it was made and how you can replicate it from scratch if you want, check the pdf file ZGW.pdf.

To open the machine, download it from the link and open it in Virtualbox on your PC / Server with FIle>Import Applicance.

Test it and if you find it useful feel free to send me a QSL card which I will much appreciate.
